                Food Chain Magnate is a heavy strategy game about building a
                fast food chain. The focus is on building your company using a

                on a variable city map through purchasing, marketing and sales,
                and on a job market for key staff members. The game can be

                Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game. Also called Gobang or
                Five in a Row, it is traditionally played with Go pieces (black
                and white stones) on a go board with 19x19 intersections;
                however, because once placed, pieces are not moved or removed
                from the board, gomoku may also be played as a paper and pencil
                game. This game is known in several countries under different
                names.
